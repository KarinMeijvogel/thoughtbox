# Welcome to the thoughtbox ðŸ’­
For this little project I wanted to experiment with speech recognition. I connected to the [Web Speech API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Speech_API) and made use of its SpeechRecognition interface.

Feel free to clone the repository, or check out the live demo [here](https://imkarin.github.io/thoughtbox/). :)
